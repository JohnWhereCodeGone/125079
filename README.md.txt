# kariomart assignment - 


Description: I wanted to make something that felt sluggish in turns but great with speed. I was inspired by the pinewood derby episode of south park. The design of the player cars was to have the pivot towards the bottom. This should make the controls a bit more frustrating, like actual pinewood derby.

2. You require the new AND old input system. The build is indexed as follows: Main menu -> lvl 0 -> lvl 1 -> lvl 2 
The required scenes are therefore Main menu, lvl 0, lvl 1, and lvl 2.

Uses unity version 2022.3.10f1.

Additional  note: I upgraded from windows 10 to 11 and have experienced some instability, your milage may vary.


3. I wanted to use this assignment as an opportunity to learn, so I tried my hand at pathing and the new input system.
With this being the case I wanted the code to be as simple as I could make it so if I broke things they'd be easier to fix.

4. WASD player1 movement, IJKL player2 movement. Tab pauses the game. The blue orb is an iffy speedboost. First player to reach the goal using the farthest path relative to player start wins and advances the next level. There are a total of 3 levels. No victory screen / score system, maintain sportsmanship for maximum enjoyment.

Google.com - Provides the start screen image, all other assets were created by me, car design was inspired by the south park episode.


6. Unity Version: 2022.3.10f1.
